Make sure to be logged into your Google Drive account

Files will be saved to "\Google Drive\bakkup\". Directory will be created on first use if not found. 

GUI can be skipped and backup/run game automatically by creating a shortcut and using the parameter "-Game Name" (same name of bakkup directory folder)

TODO:
- Find a way to deal with multiple users playing and saving at the same time.
- Find a way to check if files need to be updated or not. Compare last write times?
