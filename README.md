GUI can be skipped and backup/run game automatically by creating a shortcut and using the parameter "-Game Name" (same name of bakkup directory folder)

TODO:
- minor crashing bugs
- Find a way to deal with multiple users playing and saving at the same time.
- Find a way to check if files need to be updated or not
